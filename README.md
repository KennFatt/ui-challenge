# KennFatt's UI Challenge

Hello! Welcome to my UI Challenge repository. This repository is where I put all my exercises, solutions, and curiousity to any UI that I want to implement or learn to build with.

There should be a subdirectories prefixed with number. For example `00-template` is the subdirectory to help me to bootstrap new solution.


## ðŸ¥ª Tech Stack

Currently, my template (or let's say boilerplate) is using these technologies:

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Library to build component-based UI.
2. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility first CSS library.
3. [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor.
4. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Help me to build and manage each individual project.
5. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Free, helpful, and reliable host to put all my works to be accessible around the world.



## ðŸ™‹ What Can I do?

These are few steps to let you mess around with the repository:

1. Clone the this repository

2. Open one of subdirectory
